// Wave M foundation: the routes wave M adds, landed as contracts, guard rows and stub handlers BEFORE their owners
// implement them. OWNER: W5 (the guard lists and matrices are W5's after the foundation).
//
// A pending route is NOT registered: its path answers exactly as any unknown route does today (the root 404
// NOT_FOUND, whoever asks, with or without a session or the internal secret), so the branch deploys with no
// behaviour change and an old web or sync sees the 404 its downgrade path expects. The guard rows for it
// (domain-access/guard.ts CREATOR_ROUTES, guests/guard.ts GUEST_REFUSED_ROUTES) are already in place; the
// matrices (test/features/guests/refusals.test.ts, test/features/domain-access/creation-matrix.test.ts) check a
// pending row as "not registered, answers like an unknown route", and as a guarded route once it is not pending.
//
// To implement one: write the handler where the stub is (each stub names its file), and delete the route's entry
// below in the same change. The matrices then hold it to its guard rows.
